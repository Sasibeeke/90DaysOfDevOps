1) Create a simple file and do ls -ltr to see the details of the files refer to Notes
Ans => touch test1.txt
ls -ltr
total 4
-rwxrw-r-- 1 ubuntu jenkins    0 Jan  6 16:29 f1.txt
drwxrwxr-x 2 ubuntu ubuntu  4096 Jan  6 16:29 test
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu     0 Jan  6 16:41 test1.txt  ---see the user,groups and other permisiion here 

After change permission of user,group and other to execute permission 
chmod ugo+x test1.txt
ls -ltr
total 4
-rwxrw-r-- 1 ubuntu jenkins    0 Jan  6 16:29 f1.txt
drwxrwxr-x 2 ubuntu ubuntu  4096 Jan  6 16:29 test
-rwxrwxr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu     0 Jan  6 16:41 test1.txt -----see the user,groups and other permisiion here .

Each of the three permissions are assigned to three defined categories of users. The categories are:
owner   —   The owner of the file or  application.
"chown" is used to change the ownership permission of a file or directory.
group   —   The group that owns the file or application.
"chgrp" is used to change the gropu permission of a file or directory.
others  —   All users with access to the system. (outised the users are in a group)
"chmod" is used to change the other users permissions of a file or directory.

2) Write an article about File Permissions based on your understanding from the notes.
Ans => permissions are r(read)= 4 w(write)= 2 x(execute) =1 .
Highest permission 777.
-but effective 666 incase of a file for security reason in linux, no user will get execute permission.
-For directory case effective permission is 755.
-Minimum permission – effective permission 644 incase of a file.

3) Read about ACL and try out the commands getfacl and setfacl
Ans => Access control list (ACL) provides an additional, more flexible permission mechanism for file systems. 
It is designed to assist with UNIX file permissions. ACL allows you to give permissions for any user or group to any disc resource.
setfacl and getfacl are used for setting up ACL and showing ACL respectively.

Use of ACL :
Think of a scenario in which a particular user is not a member of group created by you but still you want to give some read or write access, 
how can you do it without making user a member of group, here comes in picture Access Control Lists, ACL helps us to do this trick.
Basically, ACLs are used to make a flexible permission mechanism in Linux.
